# Masters Thesis: Automatic Homotransphobia Detection in Italian Text

This repository includes the model I created as part of my final dissertation, focusing on the automatic detection of homotransphobia in Italian text. 

Two italians model were fine-tuned for this task: UMBERTO and ALBERTO, and their performance was compared to an instruction fine-tuned LLama 2 model. The dataset used for this task comes from the 2023 HODI shared task of EVALITA, an evaluation campaign for NLP tools in Italian (see https://www.evalita.it/campaigns/evalita-2023/)
